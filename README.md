#### This does not actually work as of now. I am not a professional coder or block chain specialist. I built this just from watching videos and getting the idea and thinking it would be a cool way to mine crypto. I am trying to learn more to make this work but as of now there seem to be a lot of issues, I just haven't learned enough to figure them out yet. 

***BlockCoin - Concepts***

- The point of BlockCoin is to create a game that users can play and create real coins by mining in the game. In the future I hope to be able tom make the game more complex (maybe eventually make it a 3-D game) but for now it will be a simple Block mining game. The concept behind BlockCoin (which is a temporary name) is to create a community kind of like Pi has done, but make it to where it is more fun for the users to mine their coins.

- I like how Pi allows users to mine on their phones and how they make it pretty even for everyone when it comes to coin creation. This will work kind of the same way, except there is a little more chance involved when it comes to creating coins which I will explain in more detail in the game rules.

- Also, as a little fore-warning, I am not a professional developer. I have a little experience with python3 building simple apps for data manipulation but I have no real backend or frontend experience. Assuming I can get this to show some signs of life, I will eventually be looking for much more experienced as well as much more talented developers to take over the development. Hopefully I strong community grows behind this idea and it is able to get that far.

***Also, I know that I am most likely missing key concepts and implementations that will be needed in order for this to work. I have no formal education in software engineering or in computer science. Everything I have done I learned from watching YouTube videos and reading articles. If there are things you know I am missing or things you think I need to do to improve upon this, please let me know. I would really appreciate any advice I can get!***



##### GAME RULES:
***BlockCoin Game Flow: How it works***
---A lot of these rules are subject to change upon hearing from other people and getting there opinion for better ideas---

+ Each user will be given a public and private key. The private key will be how the users will be allowed to play. The public key will be used to post to the blockchain that users life time stats.
+ Upon signing into the games network, The network will check to see if you have any coins being mined. It will use the public key to see if there are any coins being mined by your account. If There aren't then you will be ok to play.
+ Users will not be allowed to dig for more coins while they are currently mining. This will help control the rate of coin creation and keep it from becoming inflated.
+ As of now there will be 5 "halving" points. This will be done by changing the number of digs per session, decreasing the amount of coins spread out across the blocks, the rate of mining the coins you find will take longer, and increasing the amount of blocks to dig. I will release the exact numbers when I am closer to launching the beta.
--> As the network hits certain milestones (users, coins, blocks, etc.) these will be implemented to help keep the coins from being inflated.
+ As of now the game will have 2 main principles:
***Digging***

***Mining***
- Each player/client will be a miner. As of now there is only players/clients. Eventually We will add a computer node backend which will allow people to only mine. Once the mainnet is released there will be the game side and the backend mining side.
